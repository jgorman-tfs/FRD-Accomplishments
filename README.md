# FNRM-Accomplishments 
This repository contains information related to creating the FNRM Accomplishments Map and calcuating the UCF community stats.<br>

*Last updated 1-8-2026*
## Purpose
The FNRM Accomplishment Map is included in the FNRM Accomplishment Report that is written by Gretchen and sent to Al every quarter of the fiscal year. The map serves as a visualization of all the quarterly accomplishments. Other ancillary information is also collected and reported. 

The data from ELMR and Chris is straightforward and easy to put into a map because it's a list of counties with the assist count for each county under each category. The data from Urban and Community Forestry is less straightforward because it is just a list of cities and counties with the associated assist type. 

The FNRM_Accomplishments script automates everything from start to finish, but there are a few things that need to be in place before running through the script. 

You will need to download the Texas_Places_WithCounties and Template layers along with the Q5_2024 lyrx for symbology.
The Texas_Places_WithCounties layer has all Texas Places and the respective county they are in. This is important to match the UCF cities to the counties for accomplishments.
The Template layer is just a general county layer used to generate the final layer.
